[Ramona Saintandre](https://github.com/Ramona-Saintandre) - I am a helpdesk coordinator, I have been learing frontend development for about a year now. 
I understand JS, but I am having a issue , with putting it together. 
It is like once I see JS, my mind just goes blank. 
So like Elliot is saying I am trying to find my learning style 


[Eliot](https://twitter.com/techieEliot) - I'm from MS in the US. I teach technology and p.e. while attending a bootcamp. I'm looking to go fulltime in web development this summer. I've been learning web development on my own for a couple of years

I started going through freecodecamp and I do want to do some personal coding projects so I decided I wanted to learn more about web development and javascript

We discussed about creating a group in discord, so that we can stay in contact. 
Not sure how when we meetup on sunday if we can stay as a group, so that we can form relationships

<font color=#00ffee>**Abstract syntax tree**</font> = is something that happens behind the engine 

## from the book

Once any source program has been fully parsed, it's very common that its subsequent execution will, in some form or fashion, include a translation from the parsed form of the program—usually called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)—to that executable form.

In other words, parsed languages usually also perform code generation before execution, so it's not that much of a stretch to say that, in spirit, they're compiled languages.

JS source code is parsed before it is executed. The specification requires as much, because it calls for "early errors"—statically determined errors in code, such as a duplicate parameter name—to be reported before the code starts executing. Those errors cannot be recognized without the code having been parsed.
const abstract = 1;

1.Difference between declaring a variable and initializing a variable
2. In the book , he is talking about strict mode, right after AST, so I am wondering was he wanting us to know about AST so that we would understand how `strict` mode works ?
