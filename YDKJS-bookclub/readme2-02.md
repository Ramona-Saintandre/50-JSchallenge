Notes from Madison this for the meetup

What is 1 idea/concept/fact you learned while reading this chapter? Can you describe it to your group? (this could take each person anywhere from 4-10 minutes! 
Here are some more prompts if your  group feels they need more: 
Explain what iterators are. What is iteration? What are built-in iterables in JS? 

Next,what are closures? Explain the 'this' keyword.

What is 1 thing you struggled with or didn't understand in this reading? (I definitely have an answer for this one.)

What is 1 thing from this chapter that you can directly apply to your learning/project/job? 

With either code or just talking, present an idea or concept from the chapter to your group. 
Optional of course! But presenting something you learned from the chapter is a great way to cement what you learned. 

***When you get into your small group:***
1. Choose a host  for your group, one person who can make sure you stay on topic and go through questions :)

2. Introduce yourself, and share one coding or career goal with your group. 

3. Start the questions!


________________________________________________________________________
Tried to keep up with the Q&A with Kyle. 
Sorry had to give up, LOL
My attempt to copy some of the questions that were at least posted in the chat?

Object.is - for negative checks 
Number.is - for NaN checks 

Why is JavaScript is the language of web? 

Despite the revolving-door of frameworks, components seem to be a common paradigm to all of them. 
Are components here to stay as a pattern?


Is JavaScript a compiled language or not? 
Kyle states that in chapter one it is an elaboration to explain why JS is a compliled language 

 Q:Does the simplicity of JavaScript become a problem as a codebase grows?
  At what point does it become a problem? 
  Do you think if it becomes a problem, that indicates bad decisions were made?

  Q:Learning mulitple languages at a time, what are the pitfalls
  A: it seems that from Kyle some pitfalls are the white spaces , tabs etc 
     with other languages the are class oriented , as where JavaScript is not 

     Q: How do keep up with all of it 
     A:Kyle states that you don't , he states that it is not practical or reasonable to try and keep 
     He suggests you want to be aware of your surronding, but don't try to master everything. It is not possible or practical. 

     Q:This keyword 
     A: Kyle states that this.keyword is very unique in JS. 
        It has a lot to do with the lexical enviorment 
        there is a whole set of rules called this.binding that needs to be learned 
        read objects&protoTypes while he finshes objects&classes book 

    Q:should you do some projects in vanilla JS 
    A: Kyle states that you need to have a good foundation, it does not matter what your roof 
       looks like, if your foundation is not solid 
       typical lifecycle of a framework is 5 to 15 months 
       if you learn the foundation your job longevity should 5 to 15 years
       there are useful if you need to ramp up, framework is great to help you rapidly protoType

From meshaal to Everyone:  05:12 PM
Jokes on me then
From Miguel to Everyone:  05:12 PM

There is a great podcast called code Newbie, the host of that podcast also hosts another that likes to talk about open source and they touch on the topic of JS
From Dominic Duffin to Everyone:  05:14 PM
Yess! One of my favourite podcasts!
From David Asem to Everyone:  05:14 PM

I cant remember the name of the other but they like to talk about it on  Code Newbie
From Me to Everyone:  05:17 PM
https://syntax.fm/show/049/ssr-seo-tips-for-students-music-security-and-graphql is really good, and a lot on JS it's hosted by Wes Bos and ScottTolinski from Level up Tuts

Solid question godstime
From gmo to Everyone:  05:21 PM
Agree, good one Godstime!
From Jim to Everyone:  05:23 PM
Question: Does the simplicity of JavaScript become a problem as a codebase grows? At what point does it become a problem? Do you think if it becomes a problem, that indicates bad decisions were made?
From Me to Everyone:  05:24 PM
From a helpdesk stand point, that has always been a nightmare, even though it did give me job security. 
but trying to keep up with Java, flash, and all the other plugins was nuts 
From Madison Kanna to Everyone:  05:27 PM
everyone please mute if you are not speaking, so we can hear Kyle and others who are talking :)
From ca to Everyone:  05:27 PM
I there still time, my question is less connect to the book and more about javascript, is the following: Would Keyley change the name or never used the confusion to "Java" as he is been even a Java developer?This considering the great confusion between Recruiters and once one get very  specialist and is not too much updated to Java for example.
From Nelson Amaya to Everyone:  05:28 PM
Sorry, I missed the part regarding the e-book :( is there already a shared link?
From amanda to Everyone:  05:28 PM
Not yet
From johnf croston iii to Everyone:  05:28 PM
nope
From Nelson Amaya to Everyone:  05:28 PM
Thx!
From meshaal to Everyone:  05:28 PM
At the end, get said he will post a link
From Felipe Rueda to Everyone:  05:28 PM
I think it'll be shared at the end of the call 
From Me to Everyone:  05:29 PM
Question: When I first started learning how to code I was always told you don't need to know math ?
I am having a hard time grasping JS, and I feel that a lot has to do with me not having totally grasped math as a child. 
For people who have issues with the logic's of math, is there a way for us to grasp it?
From George Okanga to Everyone:  05:29 PM
This is really beautiful. I just started on my JS journey, and here I am literally interacting with Kyle!!!! Somebody hold me
From Madison Kanna to Everyone:  05:29 PM
:)))))))
From Sneyder Barreto to Everyone:  05:30 PM
I'm using my mobile data. Hopefully I don't get disconnected.   ü§û
From Petru to Everyone:  05:30 PM
When do you think you'll finish the second edition of YDKJS?
From gmo to Everyone:  05:30 PM
QA!
From @techieEliot Eliot Sanford USA to Everyone:  05:31 PM
Q&A
From Sneyder Barreto to Everyone:  05:31 PM
Q&A! 
From Ken to Everyone:  05:31 PM
Ramona: depends on what you do but I would say if you're just beginning with programming I don't think you need to know more than basic math like addition/subtraction/multiplication/division
From Janique-ka John to Everyone:  05:31 PM
Q&A! I don‚Äôt mind extra time to think through chapter 3
From Me to Everyone:  05:31 PM
Thanks so much Kyle, we can always read the book later but this time is greatly appreciated 
From michael to Everyone:  05:32 PM
I am stuck on the concept of Closures. The more I learn the more confused I get. Should I just forge ahead or how do I broaden my understanding?
From @techieEliot Eliot Sanford USA to Everyone:  05:32 PM
Chapter 2 & 3 are a lot to look at, plus the appendices A & B have lots of practice to go over.
From Godstime to Everyone:  05:32 PM
Thanks very much kyle
From Madison Kanna to Everyone:  05:32 PM
everyone, we are trying to go through as many questions as we can, although we will be ending the call right at the hour mark as we do not want to go over. Will try to get to as many questions as we can!!
From ca to Everyone:  05:33 PM
if there is still time, I would ask him if he would avoid now considering the confusion especially Recruiter of Javascript and Java just for the "Word" Java
From Ken to Everyone:  05:34 PM
there's some stuff like modulus which is used to find the remainder from a division operation or exponents even but there's nothing that someone can't show you in like a quick convo
From Me to Madison Kanna:  (Privately) 05:35 PM
not sure if this would be to much to ask , is it possible create a list of questions and Kyle maybe answer later
From Madison Kanna to Me:  (Privately) 05:36 PM
Will try to ask that!! So sorry, we are getting so many questions
From Me to Madison Kanna:  (Privately) 05:38 PM
yeah, this is such an honor and privelege for this opportunity. 
We read so much, and listen to so many tutorials  and to get the opportunity to actually get the author's thoughts, and insight is awesome
From Madison Kanna to Me:  (Privately) 05:39 PM
so glad to hear that! will try to get to your question if we can, there were maybe 10 questions before heh. Hopefully we have time to get to them all
From gmo to Everyone:  05:39 PM
#chills
From Maxwell Morrison to Everyone:  05:40 PM
Wow. I enjoyed that answer. Thanks so much 
From Paa Kofi Bamfo Quaicoe to Everyone:  05:40 PM

From George Okanga to Everyone:  05:41 PM
golden Kyle
From Godstime to Everyone:  05:41 PM
Sincerely, that was a life answer
From Paa Kofi Bamfo Quaicoe to Everyone:  05:41 PM
Take away ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..FOCUS
From Madison Kanna to Me:  (Privately) 05:43 PM
Would you like to ask your math question next? :)
From Me to Madison Kanna:  (Privately) 05:43 PM
sure , thanks
From Paa Kofi Bamfo Quaicoe to Everyone:  05:43 PM
GREAT TEACHER, GREAT LEADER @getify
From Madison Kanna to Me:  (Privately) 05:44 PM
Great! You can go ahead next. Thank you!
From Madison Kanna to Everyone:  05:49 PM
Again everyone please mute if you are not speaking :) If you see that I have muted you, I am just trying to keep the noises low so we can all hear :)
From Sankalp Chauhan (LivelyCoder) to Everyone:  05:49 PM
The depth of Kyle's knowledge is really exceptional, I aspire to achieve such a depth of knowledge in any particular subject
From meshaal to Everyone:  05:49 PM
Cool stuff madison
From Beth to Everyone:  05:50 PM
Thank you so much Kyle!!
From Madison Kanna to Me:  (Privately) 05:50 PM
you are next, sorry for the delay!!
From Dennis to Everyone:  05:50 PM
Despite the revolving-door of frameworks, components seem to be a common paradigm to all of them. Are components here to stay as a pattern?
From George Okanga to Everyone:  05:51 PM
I'm going to take all my tuition back. Never have I been taught like this 
From Blake Watson to Everyone:  05:51 PM
This‚Ä¶ no framework ever works out like they do in the docs in my experience :)
From Godstime to Everyone:  05:51 PM
George, you are funny
From Blake Watson to Everyone:  05:53 PM
app diet
From john f croston iii - @jfc3 to Everyone:  05:53 PM
nodding my head to that.
From michael to Everyone:  05:53 PM
How about Svelte?
From Godstime to Everyone:  05:53 PM
Hmmmm,
Deep knowledge 
From Blake Watson to Everyone:  05:54 PM
*slow clap*
From George Okanga to Everyone:  05:54 PM
this question is for me too
From Tunde James to Everyone:  05:55 PM
Major Takeaway: Learn the foundation (JS) over JS frameworks
From Joel Neely to Everyone:  05:57 PM
Read lots of good example code.
From Andrey Li to All Panelists:  05:58 PM
 I think TypeScript is very useful including identifying missing ampersand, expected value, etc.
From Joel Neely to Everyone:  05:58 PM
Start with ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù examples, and then try making small changes to them.
From George Okanga to Everyone:  05:58 PM
how do you know what code is good when you don't understand it
From gmo to Everyone:  05:58 PM
I would say maybe look at youtube videos that help visualize the concept of a for loop. I remember when I could not for the life of me conceptualize the for loop as well. 
From michael to Everyone:  06:00 PM
Kyle has a free course on JavaScript on Frontend Masters. It is great.
From Andrey Li to All Panelists:  06:00 PM
Thank you michael
From George Okanga to Everyone:  06:00 PM
I'm checking that Michael, thank you 
From bleu to Everyone:  06:00 PM
Thks for sharing your perspective Kyle. What are the resources for practising / recognising production quality code ?
From Chris Keene to Everyone:  06:01 PM
Tears daily in my first programming class...been programming for 20+ years now. Takes time.
From Beth to Me:  (Privately) 06:01 PM
I feel you. I completed a bootcamp in October and everyone was much younger than me! I‚Äôm 45. I cried almost every week and wanted to quit every few days. You can do it!!
From Blake Watson to Everyone:  06:01 PM
the industry can make it feel like you‚Äôre behind or you need to be in a hurry but taking it slowly is okay
From @techieEliot Eliot Sanford USA to Me:  (Privately) 06:01 PM
You can do it, Ramona!
Keep going!
From michael to Everyone:  06:02 PM
Love that answer.
From Nelson Amaya to Everyone:  06:02 PM
Really inspiring
From Felipe Rueda to Everyone:  06:02 PM
That's deep
From john f croston iii - @jfc3 to Everyone:  06:02 PM
keep at it Ramona it takes time.
yep.
From Blake Watson to Everyone:  06:03 PM
Guarantee you Kyle has created a lot of bugs :)
From @techieEliot Eliot Sanford USA to Everyone:  06:03 PM
You will do great, Ramona! Don‚Äôt quit! Trust the process.
From Felipe Rueda to Everyone:  06:03 PM
Love it, compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to anyone else.
